                        Made by KO Myung-Hun( komh@chollian.net )
                                                   
KCopy/2 supports file copying between VFAT and other partition,
conserving long filename.

Features :
    - Conserving long file name of VFAT partitionö
    - Copying sub directory
    - Supporting global name
    - Supporting Korean file name
    	               		
Limitations :
    - Being able to copy maximum 25 level of sub directory
    - Ignoring exception( i.e. Ctrl-Break )
    - Copying empty directory when copying directory
    - NLS is lack.

      
History :
    - v0.3.0 : 1999.11.26
               Supporting to copy between the same partitions
               
               fixed :
                   - Recognized continuous space chars of long file name
                     as one space char
               
    - v0.2.0 : 1999.07.14
               Supporting to write to VFAT
               Supporting Korean file name
               
               fixed :
                   - Do not copy if source file name is 'x:' form.
               
    - v0.1.0 : 1999.05.28
               Supporting to copy sub directory
               
               fixed :
                   - Do not work correctly if there are no global names in
                     file name
                     
    - v0.0.0 : 1999.05.23                   
               Initial release.
               
Compiling sources :

This program is programmed originally for Free Pascal v0.99.10 for OS/2 and
Virtual Pascal/2 v1.10 demo version.

- In case of VP/2(1.10 or later)
Sources should be compiled without any problems.

- In case of Free Pascal for OS/2
.Compile with v0.99.10
You should copy dos.pas and doscalls.pas to rtl\os2 directory, and modify your
ppc386.cfg correctly. If any error occur, refer to the ppc386.cfg included in
this package.

.Compile with latest version( current v1.0.6 )
You should modify source files. Free Pascal recognize 'string' as 'ansistring'
in default. So, you should {$H-} switch. You can see the following at top of
sources.

        {$IFDEF FPC}
        {$MODE DELPHI}
        {$ELSE}
        {$DELPHI+}
        {$ENDIF}

All you have to do are to insert {$H-} before {$ELSE} as the following.

        {$IFDEF FPC}
        {$MODE DELPHI}
        {$H-}
        {$ELSE}
        {$DELPHI+}
        {$ENDIF}

And, you should add '@' to parameter of DosGetInfoBlocks in 'kc.pas'.

    DosGetInfoBlocks( @PTIB, @PPIB );

This is because of declaration change of DosGetInfoBlocks.

Now, you can compile the sources successfully.
